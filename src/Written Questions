1. 2^n = O(a^n)
   3n+51 = O(n)
   100 = O(1)
   5n^3+5n-10 = O(n^3)
   3log5n = O(logn)

2. The maximum number of comparisons is 5.

3. O(n). Worst case scenario, the algorithm goes through the length of the array once.

4. If there was a very small number at the end of the array.

5. Linear O(n)
