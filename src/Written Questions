1. 2^n = O(a^n)
   3n+51 = O(n)
   100 = O(1)
   5n^3+5n-10 = O(n^3)
   3log5n = O(logn)

2. The maximum number of comparisons is 4.
   1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12
   If the computer was searching for 8
   The array would be split in 2 and the remaining numbers to check would be
   6, 8, 11, 12
   The array would be split in 2 and the remaining numbers to check would be
   6, 8
   The array would then be split in 2 again leaving only 8

3. O(n). Worst case scenario, the algorithm goes through the length of the array once because there is only 1 loop.

4. If there was a very small number at the end of the array, insertion sort would be much faster.

5. Log(n) because the speed is getting smaller(dividing) whereas all the other run times increase(multiply)
